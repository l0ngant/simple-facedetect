# Simple face detector

Here's another small project I had the opportunity to code thanks to an online Python course.
It's a simple script that finds and contours the faces found in a picture.

## Usage

* Copy the picture you want as an input in the same folder as the script
* Change the name of the input picture in line 16 accordingly
* Run the script :)
